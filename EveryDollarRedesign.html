                <ul>
                  <li>Background: EveryDollar is a financial budgeting app based on Bestselling author and money expert Dave Ramsey. It has the ability to customize your budget every month, track spending with the objective of saving money.</li>
                  <br>
                    <li>Objective: How can I design a native mobile budgeting tool to help customer understand and easily track their spending on a month-to-month basis?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>End User: For this project, I used myself; A person who wants to track spending to see where my money is going, so that I can save more.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>My Role: Solo project, so I owned the whole lifecycle from research to final prototyping
                    </li>
                </ul>

              <img class="col-lg-8 img-fluid" id=" coffeeSS" src="images/EveryDollar/current.png" alt="Current IA">
<h4>PainPoints:</h4>
<h6>Myself:</h6>
<ui>
  <li>Shows amount left to budget - but doesn’t show how much you are saving in the month.</li>
  <li>Shows a color tracker but doesn’t know which color is which</li>
  <li>Multiple clicks to see what you’ve spent for the month/what you have remaining</li>
  <li>Hard to figure out exactly where you placed your budget because of the options it gives</li>
  <li>It’s a learning tool - but education information is clicks away</li>
</ui>
<br>
<h6>User PainPoints:</h6>
<ui>
  <li>No real tutorial of how to use the tool</li>
  <li>No reports section - can’t see how well you are doing month to month</li>
  <li>Would be nice not to tap through spent/remaining pages</li>
  <li> Takes 3 steps to get to the insight of how much in the budget is remaining </li>
  <li> Not super clear which budgets went over their allotted amount</li>
  <li> Second photo, not clear which is the remaining amount for the month; $40 or $297? </li>
  <li> Takes multiple steps to get to remaining budget for the month </li>

            <div class="row col-13 Spent">

            <div class="col-lg-7 UI">
              <h4>Observations of Current UI</h4>
              <p>The green circle makes the spent money look positive. If it is a budgeting app to help the user save money, spending that close to their income amount or budget allotted is not a good thing. If tracking spent amount, the color label should indicate a negative sign when it is close to full amount.

            <p>
              From doing the competitor research, I have gathered together the majority of the painpoints and positive aspects of each app so that it can be combined into the Everydollar redesign. Here are the list of aspects the user wants to see in a budgeting app:
              <ul>
                <li> Flexibility of categories of spending</li>
    <li>Ability to see how much money is saved/left in pocket</li>
    <li>Alerts when exceeding maximum budget</li>
    <li>Allows joint account</li>
    <li>Needs auto-sync to bank accounts</li>
    <li>Search function to look up transactions</li>
    <li>History of budgets/month to month review</li>
    <li>Ability to select multiple transactions to input all at once</li>

              <div class="col-lg-4 storyboard"
            <p>
              Storyboard is based on how a user may interact with the app. User looks at credit card bill and thinks to themself "looks like I've been spending too much. I should budget my money this month". The user then opens up the Everydollar app and manually inputs her transactions from her credit card bill. After seeing how much money she has spent and how much she earns a month, she wonders how much more money she saved this month compared to last. She checks the insight page to get an overview of her monthly spending. Using this new found information, the user budgets her next month out so that she is able to save more than this current month.

                <p>A card-sort was performed to help create better information architecture so that it was based on what the users expect to see in the app. The card-sort had 10 participants all from different locations and with the background knowledge of budgeting. I did a closed card-sort, which meant I already had the categories I wanted to put in the app/ were already in the app and wanted to change the information architecture based on the data collected. Confirming assumption that users would rather see some items under a different tab/category than where EveryDollar already has it.

                      Created a user flow for four tasks that a user would commonly use the app for:
                      <ul>
                        <li> Task 1: Check to see how much money was spent this month compared to last.</li>

                      </ul>
                          Going back to the user painpoints, I have cut down the amount of steps it takes to complete some of these tasks, making for easier and more efficient use.

              For each part of the app - I tried to create 5-7 wireframes that could work. After completing each wireframe, I went back and reviewed each one to see which would be easiest to use. There are a couple frames in which I could see the final design being, so I either put a check mark next to both or a question mark so that I can mock up both during the mid-fidelity wireframe stage to make a decision.

            <h3> Three Scenarios were created for the user to perform their task:</h3>
            <p>
              5 people performed this user testing.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Scenario 1: User has just purchased an item and wants to make sure they track it in their EveryDollar app - please open the app and try to add a transaction (no actual item will be added).</li>
              <li> Scenario 2: User doesn’t want to have to manually add transactions every time they buy something so they want to connect their bank account. Please open the app and try to link a bank account. </li>
              <li> Scenario 3: Users download a budgeting app to help keep them accountable and to learn to manage their money better. Find where you can learn more about budgeting. </li>
            </ul>
            <h5> Common Findings and Soltuions:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li> Issue 1: Icons on bottom are confusing - Solution: Labeled each icon</li>
              <li> Issue 2: The "Learn to Budget" icon was not clear - Soltuion: Made larger for easier visibility</li>
              <li> Issue 3: Thought the "Learn to Budget" page would be under the "?" icon - Solution: Changed the about page icon to an "i" to signify information</li>

            <h3>Reflection:</h3>

            <p>I came into doing this app re-design with a more solid understanding of the design process as a whole. I really took the time to do my research, what was working for others, what wasn’t and what would make this app the best choice out of all of them for the user. I came to realize how important the first steps of the process are to build the foundation for your end product.
            </p>
          </p>

Doing user research and usability testing, I quickly figured out  that narrowing down your participants to the specific target audience is extremely important. I noticed I asked someone who normally budgets, but uses an excel sheet as opposed to an app, was not able to pick up on certain nuances and terminology of the app that are generic to all budgeting apps; i.e. transactions and budget. I switched my recruitment to those who have used budgeting apps in the past and when doing a usability test with these participants, they were able to navigate my redesign fairly quick and was able to give feedback from an actual users point of view. The difference in having someone familiar with budgeting apps and someone who just budgets are vast and determines the outcome of my design.
</p>
<p>

It’s also easy to assume icons are commonly used and even those who use budgeting apps may take a bit to figure out which each of the buttons signify - it’s really important to listen to them and hear their frustrations or even see in person, their hesitation to click on a button and the reason behind it. The UI of this product is important so the users can clearly understand how to use the app, which in turn, will help the continuation of use.
