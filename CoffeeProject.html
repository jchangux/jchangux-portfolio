            <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
            <p>
                When people search online for coffee shops in the area, they usually get chains such as Starbucks and
                Dunkin Donuts. If
                in the
                city, chains are around every corner and the multiple locations take up the entire search list. If they
                want
                to find
                a small coffee shop, they have to continuously scroll to find a name they don’t recognize and then
                research
                if it’s
                any good. This could mean going to website, going to yelp from google maps, etc. which is time
                consuming.

            <h3>Limitations/Constraints & Retrospective:</h3>
            <h4>Limitations:</h4>
            <p>A couple limitations I faced during this project included the competition. When I was researching
                competitors, I couldn’t find an app or website that was exactly what I was looking to do. One of the
                competitors was highlighted as a mobile coupon to the coffee shops in the area. This has pros and cons
                to
                that app that I was not trying to resolve for my users. Another limitation was the participant pool. I
                was
                hoping to get more frequent coffee drinkers so that I could analyze those who have experience drinking
                coffee in all environments. Because only a certain amount within the age range drank coffee every day,
                it
                was not a lot of data to go off of.
            </p>
            <h4>Retrospective:</h4>
            <p>I realize I lacked the brainstorming aspect of this project in the user research as well as wireframes.
                Next
                time, I will ask strategic questions that will get me better answers to see exactly the pain points
                users
                are coming across. This will really help me to understand their problems and come up with ways to solve
                it.
                After creating the user personas, I should have spent more time brainstorming multiple ways in which the
                app
                will work. Next time, I will be really think out the wireframes and brainstorm them out on paper before
                going digital.
